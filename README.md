# 🏡 Property Appraisal Report Generator

Welcome to the Property Appraisal Report Generator, an AI-driven backend solution designed to streamline real estate underwriting. This project ingests appraisal documents, automatically extracts critical property details, identifies potential hazards, computes a comprehensive risk score, and optionally evaluates property images. Built for flexibility, it can be integrated into ML pipelines and document-processing systems.

## 🔢 Features

* Analyze and parse property documents to extract key information
* Detect hazards and generate risk assessment summaries
* Support for image-based analysis (optional)
* Configurable via `requirements.txt` dependencies
* Easy to extend for PDF, database, or web UI integration
